Streams --> Sequence of data. It can be of two types
    1. Byte value
    2. Characters (Unicode)
Java performs I/O through these streams and these are just abstractions that Java provides
Java implements these within class hierarchy in java.io package

All are abstract classes

Byte stream for reading files and image. Defined in two class hierarchy: Input Stream and Output Stream

Character stream for Unicode characters. More efficient than byte stream. Two parts: Reader and Writer.

IO Exception: Corrupt file, not able to read, file not found

Pre-defined Streams in Java:
    System.out --> standard output Stream --> console
    System.in --> standard input stream --> keyboard
    System.err --> standard error --> console
