# OOPS-Java

This repository contains Java code implementations and examples related to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing OOP principles.

## Overview

OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (fields) and code (methods). This repository covers the four core principles of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**: Binding data and methods that manipulate the data within a single unit or class.
2. **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to perform different tasks based on the object or arguments.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essentials.

## Topics Covered

- Basics of Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- `this` Keyword
- Static and Instance Members
- Inheritance and Method Overriding
- Polymorphism (Compile-Time and Run-Time)
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Encapsulation with Getters and Setters
- Exception Handling in OOP
- Real-World Use Cases of OOP

## Learning Source

I am following Kunal Kushwaha's [Java Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/KunalKushwaha) on YouTube for in-depth understanding and examples of OOP concepts. His teaching style makes it easier to grasp core programming principles.

### How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OOPS-Java.git
```
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.
- Navigate to the desired topic and run the Java files to see the examples in action.

### Future Plans

- Adding more real-world examples for each concept.
- Practicing advanced OOP topics such as Design Patterns.
- Solving OOP-related coding problems.
